            <div class="paragraphy_one"><strong>What you did</strong> <br> <br> English singer Mahalia is gearing up to release her debut album, Love And Compromise on Friday, and she's given us another taste of what to expect.
                <br> <br>
            Her latest single What You Did sees her team up with Ella Mai for a tune that samples Cam'Ron's Oh Boy, and is a modern take on the 2002 smash hit, turning it into a sultry R&B track.

            <div class="paragraphy_one"><strong>Peru</strong> <br> <br> ‘Peru’ points to its author’s Afropop wit. Whether they are constructed around recurring themes of love, dance and struggle held together by catchy melodies, or undergo the soulful retooling Fireboy refers to as ‘Afro-life’, the singer has risen to the occasion. ‘Peru’ is anchored in the former, imbued with infatuation and vulgar lust, but also ambition and success that has led to his globetrotting adventures.

            An ode to Portland’s Woodlawn Park where he grew up, the rapper returns to the neighborhood, where he and his crew take over his childhood basketball court. We also see clips of Aminé riding ATVs, snowmobiles, and chilling on the couch fitted in Portland Trailblazers gear.</div>
